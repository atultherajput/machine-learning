# About this Mini Project in ML using SVM Algorithm

> I had build this mini project for Machine Learning using Support Vector Machine Algorithm. Here we have a set of emails, half of which were written by one person and the other half by another person at the same company . Our objective is to classify the emails as written by one person or the other based only on the text of the email.
